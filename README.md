# Typing-Race-Java-Test

Demo Video: https://youtu.be/MvyhU7ZtN7w

This is the Java client I wrote to test the login and game servers. I am in the process of writing the iPhone app to replace this. 

The application consists of two classes - Main and Interface. 

Main is a container for the interface object and the methods I use to read and write data to the game and login servers. 
Interface is a JFrame that displays all the information and handles user interaction.
